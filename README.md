# milc-communication-behavior
A Research & Development project to profile a benchmark program running on a parallel supercomputer, to analyze its computation/communication structure and decipher the pattern and behavior of the program, so as to re-create a synthetic version of the program for comparing performance. A synthetic program is used for studying network behavior.
